# python-class-enlistment
This Python project is a condensed interface of the **class enlistment system of De La Salle University** simulated in the command line. In this enlistment system, the user is presumed to be already logged in as a student where they can choose to (a) enlist a class, (b) drop a class, (c) view their classes, (d) view offered classes, and (e) exit.

## Project Directory Guide
1. `course.py` is a Python class file for Course objects. This describes the structure of a Course that could be taken, with properties such as a unique number, name, section, professor, units, capacity, and schedule.
2. `student.py` is a Python class file for Student objects. This describes the structure of a Student that could enlist in courses, with properties such as a unique ID number, name, college, course, maximum number of units, subjects, and schedule. It also contains functions that involve student actions such as enlisting and dropping a class.
3. `main.py` is the main Python file where the project will be run.

## Instructions for local machine use:
1. Open the command line interface and clone this repository.
2. `cd` to the directory of this repository.
3. Enter the command `python main.py`. The project should now be ready for use in the command line.
 
## Project Notes
